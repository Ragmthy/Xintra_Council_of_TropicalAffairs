A walkthrough repo for Xintra's Council of Tropical Affairs Lab


# XINTRA LABS (CoTA)
Creating a Repository of Walkthrough for CoTA Lab created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 

A third XINTRA lab attempted, the goal of this repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each section like I've done so for my previous two. 
Full innovation credits for this lab goes to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective [contributors](https://www.xintra.org/labs#:~:text=BEHIND%20THE%20LAB-,Lab%20Contributors,-Each%20lab%20is). 

More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs).
